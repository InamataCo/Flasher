In rare cases you might require the [FTDI driver][14]. This is used on some developer boards.

### Linux

1. Add your Linux user to the dialout group to gain access to the serial USB port. Run the following command in a terminal:

    `sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER`

2. Now logout and back in again. To verify the change run the following command:

    `groups`

## Future Features

This is a list of features that would be useful and show the tool's current limitations

- Handling of more than 100 site, firmware images or controller instances
  - This is due to not handling paging of the GraphQL requests
- Delete controller when creating a new on and an error occurs after registration
- Enable searching of combo boxes with many items
  - This is described on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4827207/how-do-i-filter-the-pyqt-qcombobox-items-based-on-the-text-input)
- Use PlatformIO as an flash/upload tool?: https://community.platformio.org/t/upload-latest-build-without-a-compile-link/9520
